### Contributing
This site is being developed by cohort 20 students to showcase what we have learned. If you need access, please notify via the #day-cohort-20 Slack channel.

To work on the project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed/updated, clone the repo, and run npm install in the lib directory.

Please note that any changes to the cohort.json student info data will not go live until Grunt bundles the dist/app.js file.

We are also using editorconfig and eslint to keep the code clean. Depending on your choice of editor, you may need to install plugins and/or install the npm package globally.

Also note that we are using the latest version of Bootstrap (4.0.0 Beta), which may differ a bit from what you are used to.  The docs are [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/).

If you are not a c20 student but really want to contribute, feel free to fork and make a pull request!
